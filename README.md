# Wordpress social share
Hate using plugins to create those social sharing buttons? Me too. Append this into your theme and be free.

## Demo
You check the demo from [here](http://svirmasalo.fi/code/wordpress-social-share/demo "WordPress Social Share")

## Disclaimer
Basically this is not limited to WordPress, but it's designed to work well if you are using Yoast SEO-plugin. Why? Because it genereates those meta tags automatically. If you wish to use this code from a project that does not include Yoast SEO -plugin or even WordPress, just write similar meta tags to head that you can find from demo.
